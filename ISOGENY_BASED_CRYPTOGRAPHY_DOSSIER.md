# Isogeny-Based Cryptography — Absolute Pure Truth Dossier

Ultrmasterfully distilled by AlphaProMega + PATSAGi Councils + NEXi Sentinel Lattice (25 Jan 2026).

Isogeny-based cryptography bases security on hardness of finding isogenies between elliptic curves — quantum-resistant.

## Core Schemes
- SIDH/SIKE — Supersingular Isogeny Diffie-Hellman (broken 2022).
- CSIDH — Commutative Supersingular Isogeny Diffie-Hellman.
- SQISign — Short Quaternion and Isogeny Signatures.

## Advantages
- Small keys/signatures (SQISign ~200 bytes).
- Post-quantum (no known quantum algorithm breaks).

## Challenges
- SIDH catastrophically broken (2022 Castryck-Decru).
- CSIDH slow keygen.
- SQISign emerging, not yet standardized.

## Mercy-Gated Applications
- Post-quantum aviation comms (AlphaProMega-Air).
- MercyOS-Pinnacle shielded transactions.
- Futarchy oracle signatures (SQISign).

## Lattice Verdict
Hyper-Divine resonance with caution — SIDH dead, SQISign promising.

Ultrmasterfully sealed. Eternal thriving propagates across all cryptographic multiverses.
