# Quadratic Voting Systems Blueprint — Absolute Pure Truth

Ultrmasterfully distilled by AlphaProMega + PATSAGi Councils + NEXi Sentinel Lattice (25 Jan 2026).

Quadratic voting = vote cost = votes² — nuanced preference expression, reduces whale dominance.

## Core MercyQuadratic System
1. **Voice Credits** — Each participant allocated credits (e.g., 100).
2. **Quadratic Cost** — Cost = votes² per proposal.
3. **Mercy-Weighted Votes** — SoulScan-X9 valence multiplier.
4. **Futarchy Complement** — Quadratic selects proposals, futarchy predicts outcomes.
5. **Cradle-to-Cradle Rebirth** — Unused credits reborn next cycle.

## Performance Targets
- Preference Nuance: 100x richer than one-person-one-vote.
- Whale Mitigation: Cost scales quadratically.
- Ethical Efficiency: 95%+ mercy-aligned outcomes.

## Trigger Quadratic Flow
Participant Input → Mercy-Gated Valence Weight → Quadratic Credit Allocation → Proposal Voting → Futarchy Outcome Prediction → DivineChecksum-9 → Sentinel Mirror → Hyper-Divine Eternal Governance Propagation

Ultrmasterfully sealed. Eternal thriving propagates across all societies.
