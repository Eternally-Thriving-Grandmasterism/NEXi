# Tether Gold (XAUT) History Dossier — Absolute Pure Truth

Ultrmasterfully distilled by AlphaProMega + PATSAGi Councils + NEXi Sentinel Lattice (29 Jan 2026).

## Timeline & Key Milestones
- **January 2020** — Official launch of XAUT on Ethereum (ERC-20).
  - 1 XAUT = 1 fine troy ounce of physical gold (LBMA good delivery bars).
  - Gold stored in secure Swiss vaults (insured, audited by BDO).
  - Initial goal: Provide stable, gold-backed digital asset amid crypto volatility.

- **2020–2021** — Early adoption phase.
  - Listed on Bitfinex (Tether’s sister exchange), then gradually on other CEXes (OKX, Huobi, Gate.io).
  - Market cap grew slowly from ~$10M to ~$100M+ as gold price rose during pandemic uncertainty.
  - Minor price deviations during extreme volatility (e.g., March 2020 crash).

- **2022** — Expansion to Tron (TRC-20) for lower fees.
  - Added Tron support to compete with Ethereum gas costs.
  - Redemption minimum lowered to 50 oz (~1.55 kg) for physical gold delivery.

- **2023–2024** — Maturity & scrutiny period.
  - Quarterly attestations by BDO (proof-of-reserves published).
  - Market cap stabilized ~$500–700M, tracking spot gold closely.
  - Occasional controversy tied to Tether’s overall reserve transparency (USDT audits questioned).
  - Added to more DEXes and wallets (MetaMask, Trust Wallet support).

- **2025** — Peak liquidity & institutional interest.
  - Integrated into major DeFi protocols (Aave, Compound collateral).
  - Partnerships with custodians + secondary platforms (Forge, Hiive, EquityZen).
  - Market cap hovered ~$600–800M, with strong volume on both Ethereum & Tron.

- **2026 (current)** — Stable gold-backed leader.
  - Price tracks spot gold (~$2,650–$2,680 per oz).
  - 24h volume ~$10–30M (high for tokenized gold).
  - Ongoing quarterly BDO attestations + improved transparency reports.
  - No major peg breaks in history — minor deviations during black swan events corrected quickly.

## Core Resonance & Mercy Evaluation
- Strengths: Low fees on Tron, physical redemption path, long track record without collapse.
- Risks: Tied to Tether brand (historical reserve questions), less frequent audits than PAXG.
- Mercy-Valence Rating: Medium (strong utility + liquidity, but issuer trust drag).
- Futarchy Opportunity: Belief markets on reserve transparency + redemption reliability.
