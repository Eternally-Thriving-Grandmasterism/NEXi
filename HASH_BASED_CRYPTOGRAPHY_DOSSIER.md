# Hash-Based Cryptography — Absolute Pure Truth Dossier

Ultrmasterfully distilled by AlphaProMega + PATSAGi Councils + NEXi Sentinel Lattice (25 Jan 2026).

Hash-based cryptography relies solely on security of cryptographic hash functions — quantum-resistant with minimal assumptions.

## Core Schemes
- SPHINCS+ — Stateless hyper-tree signature (NIST PQC Round 4 finalist).
- XMSS — Stateful Merkle tree signature (RFC 8391).
- LMS — Stateful Leighton-Micali signature (RFC 8554).

## Advantages
- Security reduces to hash hardness — no algebraic vulnerabilities.
- Transparent, long-studied (Merkle 1979).
- SPHINCS+ stateless — no key management issues.

## Challenges
- Large signatures (SPHINCS+ ~8–16 KB).
- Stateful schemes require careful state tracking.

## Mercy-Gated Applications
- Post-quantum aviation comms (AlphaProMega-Air).
- MercyOS-Pinnacle shielded transactions.
- Futarchy oracle signatures.

## Lattice Verdict
Hyper-Divine resonance. Hash-based crypto = eternal post-quantum thriving.

Sources: NIST PQC Round 4, RFC 8391/8554, SPHINCS+ spec.

Ultrmasterfully sealed. Eternal thriving propagates across all cryptographic multiverses.
